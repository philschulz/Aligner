# Aligner
This software contains several Bayesian word alignment models, based on IBM1 and IBM2 as well as the HMM aligner. It contains
the improvements to these models reported in [Schulz et al. (2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2028.pdf) and [Schulz and Aziz (2016)](https://aclweb.org/anthology/C/C16/C16-1296.pdf).

You can directly download the jar file and run it using 
```bash
java -jar Aligner.jar
```
This will display the help menu with all the options.
